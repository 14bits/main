# UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

1. Where to find the builds ?

	- They are uploaded here as the dev team does builds: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11R71oZGZiHWoYmex7jeSowZFcDxvxX5i
	- dev is for development

2. How to make an Issue

	- Make a screen recording and upload it to the assets folder in the builds google drive.
	- Then make an Issue and copy the URL to the Video that you uploaded to the google drive.
	- Finally tag the issue with the right labels:
		- use the UAT label.
		- also the right Mod or Plugin label so we can control everything.

3. The developer will look at it and then respond.

	- The developer will tag the issues with "uat-ready" to show that its ready for testing.
	- When a new release cycle happens the UAT team should find all UAT bugs marked as  "uat-ready" and then regress through them all to make sure they are fixed.
	- If they are fixed then you just need to close it.

There is no 4 for now ...
